To navigate this repository. Start wtih the core files; PMMH for LV, PMMH for GBM and the Gibbs sampler. Frm this you can 
then navigate to the other associated GBM and LV plots that implement this code. This will produce the figures and tables 
present in the report. For the plots shown through section 2 and 3 please go to the extra plots file. For the
Lotka-Volterra plots, please go to the Lotka-Volterra analytical vs numerical section This should take you through all
relevant code required for this project. Please note that computation time is substantial and long wait times are to be expected.
